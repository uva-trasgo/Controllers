/**
 * @ingroup Dev
 * @brief Hitmap functions to allocate memory.
 *
 * This is a set of macro-functions that allocate memory and check the result. 
 * They print an error message if the allocate routine fails. 
 * This is an interface for Hitmap developers.
 *
 * These macros include a cast of the result pointers for compatibility with C++.
 * In C langauge the cast is not needed because the stdlib malloc function should return
 * a void pointer.
